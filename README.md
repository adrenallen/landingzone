## What is this?
A real-time strategy game with some "base building" elements.  The goal of the game is to move soldiers to various cities around the map to rescue civilians.  When your soldiers are near civilians, you can give civilians commands.  You then bring the civilians back to the helipad at the center of the map, call the helicopter, and rescue them.

Every so often, you gain communication with your soldiers and can send them commands.  You can also place new obstacles at this point as well to help you fend off zombies.

Zombies are continuously spawning, and you must balance rescuing civilians with hunting down their zombie nests and destroying them.  The longer you wait to destroy the nest, the stronger the nest becomes, and the more zombies you must fight.
